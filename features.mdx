## Document Organization and Folders

You create hierarchical folder structures to keep related documents together. Folders support unlimited nesting, making large projects easy to navigate.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Folder" icon="plus">
    Navigate to your workspace root and select "New Folder".
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Documents" icon="file-text">
    Drag files into the folder or use the upload button.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Nest Folders" icon="folder-plus">

  </Step>
</Steps>

Example folder structure:

```yaml
workspace/
├── api/
│   ├── endpoints.mdx
│   └── auth.mdx
├── guides/
│   └── quickstart.mdx
└── README.mdx
```

## Version Control for Docs

hell4uk integrates with Git, so you commit, branch, and merge changes like code. Every document revision is tracked automatically.

<CodeGroup tabs="Bash,CLI">
  ```bash
  # Initialize Git in your workspace
  git init
  git add .
  git commit -m "Initial docs commit"
  git push origin main
  ```
  ```bash
  # From hell4uk CLI
  hell4uk git init
  hell4uk git commit -m "Update features"
  hell4uk git push
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Callout kind="tip">

## Search and Indexing

hell4uk indexes all content for fast, full-text search. Query across folders, metadata, and even code blocks.

<Expandable title="Advanced Search Syntax" default-open="false">

Use operators like `AND`, `OR`, and quotes:

```
"project setup" AND api
folder:guides quickstart
```

</Expandable>

Example API search:

<Request tabs="JavaScript,cURL">
  ```javascript
  const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/search?q=authentication', {
    headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${YOUR_API_KEY}` }
  });
  ```
  ```bash
  curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
       "https://api.example.com/search?q=authentication"
  ```
</Request>

<Response>
  ```json
  {
    "results": [
      {
        "id": "doc-123",
        "title": "Authentication Guide",
        "snippet": "Use Bearer tokens for API access..."
      }
    ],
    "total": 5
  }
  ```

<ParamField path="q" param-type="string" required="true">
  Search query string.
