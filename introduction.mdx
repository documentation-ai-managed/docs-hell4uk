## Overview

hell4uk provides a centralized platform for managing your project documentation. You create organized spaces for different projects, write content in MDX format, and collaborate with your team seamlessly. This eliminates scattered docs across tools like Google Docs, Notion, or GitHub wikis, giving you version control, search, and publishing in one place.

With hell4uk, you maintain living documentation that evolves with your codebase. Focus on content while the platform handles rendering, search indexing, and deployment.
